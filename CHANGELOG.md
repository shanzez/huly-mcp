# @firfi/huly-mcp

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Prepare the next minor release from the four merged PRs since `v0.6.3`.

  - Add nested document creation with `create_document(parent)` for creating children under an existing document.
  - Fix markup conversion to use workspace-aware URL configuration so generated links and asset references resolve correctly for the active workspace.
  - Add lead and funnel tools with stronger SDK parity, deterministic funnel name resolution, and integration coverage for real workspace lead reads.
  - Add organization CRM and customer-management tools, including organization CRUD, customer mixin support, organization channels, member linking, ambiguity-safe lookup, idempotent membership operations, and cleanup-safe integration coverage.

## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- dbd3aea: Fix assignee resolution for workspace members whose email exists only as a SocialIdentity by moving the lookup into the shared person resolver and prioritizing it ahead of Channel-based lookups.

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix assignee resolution for workspace members whose email exists only as a SocialIdentity (no Channel doc). Adds SocialIdentity email lookup as the first step in findPersonByEmailOrName, benefiting all person-resolving operations.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix local-release script to rebuild dist before publish, preventing stale version string in bundle

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- ef56789: Add custom fields support with auto-discovery: `list_custom_fields`, `get_custom_field_values`, and `set_custom_field`. The server now discovers field definitions from Huly's Attribute system without manual configuration and supports Cards, Issues, and other classes with custom fields.

  Harden typed outputs for the new custom-fields, issue-relations, time, and workspace tool surfaces. These tools now validate and encode their MCP responses through Effect schemas at the boundary so branded internal domain values are converted to stable wire output and invalid result shapes fail fast instead of leaking through the transport layer.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 81c6ab2: Add custom fields support with auto-discovery: list_custom_fields, get_custom_field_values, set_custom_field tools. Auto-discovers field definitions from Huly's Attribute system without manual configuration. Works for Cards, Issues, and any class with custom fields.

## 0.1.62

### Patch Changes

- feat: add `list_statuses` and `list_inline_comments` tools

  - `list_statuses`: returns project statuses with isDone, isCanceled, isDefault flags — useful for LLMs to pick valid statuses when creating/updating issues
  - `list_inline_comments`: extracts inline comment threads from document markup with optional thread reply fetching including sender names

## 0.1.61

### Patch Changes
